c. Input: 8812
   FLE encoded string length: 70396
   Huffman assignment.txt encoded string length: 42601
   Huffman syllabus.txt encoded string length: 42083
   Shortest is syllabus.txt, assignment.txt is only 518 longer
   
d. Huffman random.txt encoded string length: 55973
   Not as good as the other two using huffman coding, but still
   better than fixed length encoding.
