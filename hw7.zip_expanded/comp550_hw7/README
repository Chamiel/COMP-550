Medium sometimes cluster with Large due to the heights being similar for the dataset,
and the height of the Cocker Spaniel is decently lower than any of the data points from
the data set, leading it to be sometimes classified as small. It all depends on the
initial centroids, and this can even cause it to be classified as large (rarely).
